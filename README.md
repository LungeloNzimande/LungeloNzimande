### âœ¨ About me
I'm a Full Stack developer with 8+ years of experience. I have worked for different companies where I have been exposed to different processes and technologies. I have also worked with different developers around the world over the past years. 

#### ðŸ“œ History
My passion for technology started back in 2006 when I had my first computer. I started trying to figure out how computers worked, especially software. In 2011 I wrote my first code while learning the basics of VB, PHP, HTML and Javascript. This is where I discovered my passion for coding.

After completing my studies, I joined a start-up company where I started gaining relevant hands-on experience. From there, I joined a 12 months graduate program where I was mentored by experienced developers who guided us when it comes to foundational skills ranging from how a sprint is managed, understanding business requirements, source control and more. 

From then, I have worked on many projects, been part of many teams from different companies. 

What I enjoy the most as a developer is that there is always something to learn, a new library, framework to try and amazing developers that have cool tips and tricks to share! I have worked with developers from different parts of the world (UK, Brazil, India, Isle of man, Spain, Peru, to mention a few) which has been an amazing experience becuase you get to learn about other things besides just code.
