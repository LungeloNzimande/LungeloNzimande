### âœ¨ About me
I'm a Full Stack developer with 8+ years of experience. I have worked for different companies where I have been exposed to various processes and technologies. I have also worked with different developers.

#### ðŸ“œ History
My passion for technology started back in 2006 when I had my first computer. I started trying to figure out how computers worked, especially software. In 2011 I wrote my first code while learning.

After completing my studies, I joined a start-up company where I started gaining relevant hands-on experience. From there, I joined a 12-month graduate program where I was mentored by experienced developers.

Since then, I have worked on many projects and been part of many teams from different companies.

What I enjoy the most as a developer is that there is always something to learn, a new library or framework to try, and amazing developers with cool tips and tricks to share! I have worked with many developers.
